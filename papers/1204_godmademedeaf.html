		<h1>God Made Me Deaf: Accounts from Deaf Latter-day Saints, 1846–1916</h1>
		<p>Who remembers Gene Petersen? I love his explanation of the Deaf World, which can be elusive for hearing people to understand:</p>
		<blockquote>“To me, the world is full of deaf people. To you, there aren’t all that many...the deaf community in the U.S. is like a small or medium-sized town, even though it starts in Maine and goes to California.”</blockquote>
		<p>For the entire United States Deaf community, Brother Petersen means a ‘Pittsburgh’ or a ‘Cincinnati.’ The LDS Deaf Community equivalents are Roosevelt, Utah and Middleton, Idaho. Even Deaf members who live in the Wasatch Front are still essentially in the mission field. There is the equivalent membership of roughly one Deaf “stake” within the entire state of Utah. If we’re going to hold a testimony meeting, you are the congregation, and you have one job: that is to affirm the speaker’s witness of truth. In our Church, we do that by responding with one word, “Amen.” [Teach sign for AMEN]</p>
		<p>Instead of closing with my testimony, I will go first to allow the other speakers ample time. You didn’t come here tonight to hear me; you came to hear the special guests!</p>

		<h2>Annie Voss</h2>
		<p>It is March 16th, 1896, and we are with a group of children from the new Latter-day Saint Deaf-Mute Sunday School. Little Annie May Voss has been there since the beginning. She is now twelve years old, and came to the Utah School for the Deaf four years previous, the same year the Deaf Sunday School class began. These children have been invited to provide a demonstration to the Sabbath School Workers for the entire Salt Lake Stake. We don’t know how many of the 1,100 of them are in attendance, but we know that the Fourteenth Ward Assembly Hall is packed; many people have come tonight to see what these Deaf pupils have accomplished.</p> 
		<p>After the opening prayer, two older girls give a hymn in sign language, and then it is Annie’s turn. Her assignment is to stand in front of this vast congregation of hearing teachers, all of them looking directly at her, and explain to them what she has been learning. How do you think she feels right now?</p> 
		<p>Well, she fulfilled her assignment, and the next day, a report was published in the newspaper. This is how she was received:</p>
		<blockquote>“Little Annie Voss told the meeting what she learned...last Sunday, going through the motion of making a vigorous address, without words. The aptness of the little mimic was amusing as well as pathetic, as illustrating the great disadvantage the deaf mutes suffer in the loss of speech and hearing.”</blockquote>
		<p>When Sister Voss bore her testimony that day, do you think the huge congregation of hearing adults truly received it? Remember in the 19th century, “pathetic” was a rough equivalent of our “special.” Do you receive her testimony tonight? 115 years later, we tell her finally, amen. [sign AMEN]</p>

		<h2>Amy Devine Hawkins</h2>
		<p>After Annie sat back down, six older students arose and signed a song for the crowd. Among this small ensemble was Amy Devine, nineteen years old. Smart, a reporter on the school newspaper. Born in Oregon, and grew up in Idaho Falls and then Morgan, Utah until finally beginning school when she was eleven years old. She was not a member of the LDS Church, but nevertheless faithfully attended Sunday School with the Mormon pupils for probably about seven years until she graduated in June 1899.</p>
		<p>It seems like she enjoyed her time with the Deaf Sunday School. I’ll let her tell you the rest, which she wrote in around 1916:</p>
		<blockquote>“I used to attend the Baptist Church for one year, but I attended the Latter-Day Saints Sunday School for a few years in Salt Lake City and Ogden. Bro Henry C. Barrell and Laron Pratt were my former teachers. I was baptized [in the Ogden River] on the 8th of July 1900 and then I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I held the [position of] Secretary for the Sunday School for the Deaf at the Ogden Fourth Ward for one year. I taught some deaf kindergarten boys and girls.”</blockquote>
		<p>Amy actually began the first records we have for that organization. Nothing exists for the previous ten years’ worth of classes. Within the first few pages, Amy records on the first Sunday of November 1902 that four of the eight teachers are absent that day. The lessons are cancelled, and instead 13 people speak, one by one, on what she calls “the subject of the Gospel.” Though it may have happened previously, this is the first evidence we have of a Deaf testimony meeting, and the first week of the next month, only one teacher is absent, but Secretary Devine records that again 13 “officers and pupils spoke and bore testimony to the work in which we are engaged.” Now, Testimony Meeting is not a backup plan; it is a pattern. And finally,</p>
		<blockquote>“I was married to Leo Hawkins on the 17th of June 1903 in the Salt Lake Temple. We have three fine daughters and one son. Our oldest girl is eleven years old and our youngest son is six months old. I stay at our own home and am taking care of our children and housekeeper since I was married.”</blockquote>
		<p>The Utah School for the Deaf had been operating for about five years, right in Leo Hawkins’ hometown before he was finally enrolled at eighteen years old. It truly was a one-room schoolhouse. Look at Leo and his tiny seatmate who had probably also just arrived at school. Guess who was the secretary for his dictated personal count? This is Leo’s actual signature, but we can compare his with the handwriting in the next page:</p> 
		<blockquote>“I was born in the First Ward, Salt Lake City, Utah on the 23rd of November 1872...I started to school for the Deaf in Salt Lake City when I was about 18 years old, and attended there and Ogden for a few years. I work as the carpenter since now.</blockquote>
		<p>By now you’ve gotten the message that the School for the Deaf moved from SLC to Ogden.</p>
		<blockquote>“I was baptized by John Cottom on the 1st of May 1883. I attended the Sunday School for the Deaf in Salt Lake City and Ogden for a number of years. I worked in the Salt Lake Temple and my grandmother Miriam Gove Chase gave me some names of her dead relatives and I was baptized for them in the temple. I was married to Amy Devine on the 17th of June, 1903 in the Salt Lake Temple. My wife and I...moved to Bountiful, Utah since 12 years. I have three daughters and one son, which I feel thankful for the blessing.”</blockquote>
		<p>Though isolated at Church through the early years of their marriage, Leo and Amy remained devout. Shortly after they submitted these personal histories, the second Deaf Sunday School class for Deaf members, this time in the Salt Lake City area formed in 1921. Dozens of members traveled many miles to attend, but Amy and Leo were lucky: it was hosted in their own ward. Brother and Sister Hawkins left a legacy of faith. From a granddaughter:</p>
		<blockquote>“Thank you for your kind words about my Grandmother. She was a busy one...My grandfather was deaf also and he would tease me and she would scold him but we were having fun...We would have to behave ourselves. He was also very well liked. I wanted to learn to speak on my hands and my Grandma told me to just write it down. I know she loved me.”</blockquote>
		<p>How many Deaf grandparents are here? Do you worry about whether your grandchildren will understand that you love them, or that you have a testimony, despite of limited communication? They know. Note that their fifth child would be born when Leo was 48 and Amy 44 years old. Leo never seemed to run out of energy. The last we hear of him is about 6 months before he died (his wife had been gone for about three years now), the Salt Lake Valley Deaf Branch newsletter records:</p>
		<blockquote>“He lives by himself in Bountiful. He is quite capable of doing his own cooking and housework. He is well known and loved by his neighbors and church members there.”</blockquote>
		<p>Do you think Amy and Leo were self-conscious about their ability to write? Does it matter now to us that their English wasn’t perfect? From reading their first-person accounts, do you think that Amy and Leo had a testimony of the Gospel? Do you think they believed in the principles of work and self-reliance? Do you think their examples taught the importance of Temple work and eternal families? If you do, then join with me in affirming their testimonies. [Sign AMEN]</p>
	
		<h2>Laron Pratt</h2>
		<p>Who’s next? We’ve heard about this good man; now let’s hear from him. Born in Winter Quarters to Orson Pratt and his first wife, Sarah. Became Deaf around three years old from a high fever. He was highly educated at a time when there was no school for Deaf children in Utah. He worked a typesetter at the Deseret News for many years which gave him several advantages:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>His English skills were superior</li>
			<li>He was well-informed on both the Gospel and secular issues</li>
			<li>He could place articles about Deaf people in the newspaper</li>
			<li>He was respected in the Community</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Laron Pratt believed in personal ministry. He trudged through the snow to talk to Wilford Woodruff about his desire to teach Deaf members of the Church in 1881, and the prophet recorded the visit:</p>
		<blockquote>“A Snowy day...Conversation with Laron Pratt who had been Def &#38; dumb through sickness. He felt as though he would like to go and teach the gospel to the Deaf &#38; Dumb mutes. He is vary[sic] intelligent and Can talk so I Can understand him.”</blockquote> 
		<p>Was there even a class to teach Deaf members the Gospel in Utah in 1881? Were there opportunities to serve a mission to Deaf nonmembers? There wasn’t even a school for Deaf children until 1884. How could Laron have possibly seen this as his destiny?</p>
		<p>Laron’s first Patriarchal blessing at age 22 promised ”many shall be convinced of the Lord thy God through your faithful testimony from time to time...and [you] shall preach the gospel from City to City,” and he believed it. His second Patriarchal blessing at age 31 promised “wisdom shall be given thee above many of thy brethren &#38; Thou shalt be an instrument in the hands of the Lord, in doing much good,” and he committed himself to it.</p>
		<p>He saw himself as a leader, and family saw him as their Head. By the time he was sixteen, Laron’s mother Sarah, Orson Pratt’s first wife, and all of his older brothers have either died or left the Church, so he functions as the birthright son. Laron organizes and hosts family celebrations, several times delivering speeches to a large crowd of extended relatives. On one such occasion, he wrote a tribute to his own father, which was read out by his favorite half-brother Milando. Here is an excerpt:</p>
		<blockquote>“Our heavenly Father gave us mortal existence for a little season to see what use we will make of it...My brothers and sisters let us be faithful, earnest and valiant in the good work. May the Spirit of God rest upon you that your joys and pleasures be unbounded this day, in the name of Jesus. Amen.”</blockquote>
		<p>What is Laron Pratt sharing his testimony of? I hear: trials of mortality, faith and enduring to the end, blessings of the Gift of the Holy Ghost. A decade earlier, Milando and an even younger brother served a mission to the Eastern States. These younger boys get to see the world and preach the gospel. Do you think Laron wanted to build the Kingdom of God too?</p>
		<p>The day Orson gathered his family for Milando’s departure, it was Laron who was designated to lead the group of forty family members and friends to surprise Milando at home. They brought a picnic spread and a substantial sum of money. Laron’s handwritten farewell address was read aloud by his half-sister Dora. Here is a tiny portion:</p>
		<blockquote>“It has pleased an All-wise Providence, through his servants to call you on a mission to the nation [sic, singular] of the earth, to disseminate such principles and doctrines as will tend to save the human family.” This is a testimony of: the character of God, Priesthood authority, missionary work, plan of salvation...we all sincerely, and with one accord, wish you God speed in the work you have been called to perform, trusting that your ability and integrity of heart and a firm faith in the guiding hand of an Omnipotent Being...that you will perform all the duties assigned you in faithfulness...”</blockquote> 
		<p>What do you see? I see a testimony of faith, hope, charity; the calling and duty of a missionary. And I don’t hear any bitterness.</p>
		<blockquote>"May the Lord God of heaven and earth bless you, and open the way for you from day to day, and show you the path wherein you should walk...that you will be permitted to return home again to [our] presence, with ten fold experience and an abiding faith in the mercy and goodness of God. This is our wish which may God grant in the name of Jesus Christ.”</blockquote>
		<p>I see a belief in the gift of the Holy Ghost, blessings of missionary work to the missionary, God's mercy and beneficence, and that God will answer our prayers. This letter announces the Latter-day Saint Deaf-Mute Sunday School, the first organized program for Deaf people in the history of the Church. Brother Pratt is going to be an instructor. Without him, none of us would be gathered here either.</p>
		<p>The Deaf-Mute Sunday School became the first Deaf branch in Ogden in 1917. These children grew up, and a Sunday School formed in Bountiful, which became the Salt Lake Valley Deaf Branch in 1949. From there, Deaf Saints fanned out and formed congregations in California, Arizona, and other locations where they eventually cried out for full-time missionaries, who began <em>teaching</em> Deaf people in 1968. Returned missionaries began to teach ASL at the MTC and BYU, where I began taking classes in 1988. I owe my livelihood — a 20-year interpreting career — to this man.</p>
	 	<p>Do you want to hear his testimony of the vision he had for himself and for all of us? In his calling as Assistant Superintendent of the Deaf Sunday School, he is also fulfilling his duties as a Sunday School missionary, Elder Pratt and his companion visited a Hearing congregation in the Brighton Ward (my ward!) on September 14, 1894.</p>
		<blockquote>“...in a speech of some ten minutes' duration, [Elder Laron Pratt] bore a strong testimony of the truth of the Gospel and pointed out to his attentive audience the Divine providence in his behalf in placing him under what most people regarded as an affliction, but in which he realized a blessing for the situation in life which he had occupied.”</blockquote>
		<p>The promises in his Patriarchal Blessing twenty-five years ago are all coming true. He is teaching the Deaf, and traveling to proclaim the Gospel!</p>
		<blockquote>“...His testimony made a deep and lasting impression upon the people, who felt the force of a remark by him to the effect that his apparent affliction was proving a blessing from which the disguise was being removed to his own comprehension.”</blockquote>
		<p>What about Laron Pratt’s testimony gave him such a firm conviction of God’s will in his Deaf identity? Deaf people are blessed to be as they are, not to be fixed, not to be made miraculously into Hearing people, and are full heirs in the Kingdom of God. And by extension, that means, so is everyone.</p>
		<p>What Laron Pratt envisioned on that snowy day more than 130 years ago, when he expressed the desire of his heart to a prophet of God, planted the seed which has grown and multiplied all over the world. The Church listened to Deaf people first through the voice of Laron Pratt, and his testimony is for the entire Church, not just Deaf members. Do you receive it? [Sign AMEN]</p>
	
		<h2>John Sherratt</h2>
		<p>And now, our final speaker. John Sherratt was born into an upper-class English family, and deafened in infancy by scarlet fever. His father died when he was just a toddler, and mother remarried when he was about five. The family had an estate including servants, and his occupation is documented as “Gentleman,” so we can assume that John had a tutor. He was most definitely literate, and reportedly trained in bookkeeping.</p>
		<p>The family left for Zion on April 6, 1849 and travelled first class to Kanesville, Iowa where they would remain for three years in vastly different circumstances. John handed over $6,000.00 to open a store — in his stepfather’s name — that was intended to operate as his livelihood.</p>
		<p>John’s financial interest in the frontier store combined with his rather legendary generosity nearly ruined him. Orson Hyde, who had baptized him, still felt protective of John, and assumed all legal responsibility for his affairs — a adult, married man — to which the entire family consented, Hyde announcing:</p>
		<blockquote>“It is well known to this community that the above named gentleman is deprived of hearing and speech; and being naturally free and generous hearted, advantages are often taken of him...to the prodigal squandering of his property by which himself and family may be reduced to want...no debts of his contracting will be paid, unless his trustee authorize the said debts.”</blockquote>
		<p>So John literally got a Frontier Guardian; for the next two years, Orson Hyde would remain responsible for John.</p>
		<p>Three months after finally making it to Utah, his infant son Orson Smith Sherratt died. Amid tension in their marriage, the last child is born in June 1854, and John joins his stepfather in the Southern Indian Mission that October.</p>
		<p>It seems Brigham Young thought a Deaf person who signed would be a good fit among the Indians who—sort of do the same thing. There is evidence he had enough contact with the tribes for them to give him a Paiute name: Tompats, or “Can’t Talk.” John Sherratt, in 1854, is the first Deaf man called to a full-time mission. It will be 112 years before the Church resumes formally calling Deaf missionaries who can sign, and it will be 114 years before the Church formally calls Deaf missionaries to teach Deaf people.</p> 
		<p>For whatever reason, John enjoys Southern Utah, and holds out hope that his estranged wife Sarah and their daughter will join him. By the time he is released in January 1855, Sarah had already made up her mind, finalized the divorce, and taken both his inheritance and their daughter. After she remarries, we can safely assume he never sees them again; his child is raised with the stepfather’s name.</p>
		<p>If he had remained in Salt Lake City, he might have met the other Deaf adult members with whom he could have shared companionship and spirited gospel discussions. He might have become a respected leader when Deaf members began to hold meetings. As it happened, there is no evidence he ever joined with them, or even knew about their existence. We can assume he lived the rest of his life completely isolated from other Deaf Mormons.</p>
		<p>However, don’t mourn for John Sherratt; less than one year later, he eloped with the eleven-years-younger hearing girl Christina Bulloch, against her parents’ wishes. Maybe she was smitten with his noble bearing; he turned heads all over town with the impressive way he dressed, walked, and of course communicated. She learned to sign with him; family members reported that he taught friends and relatives the British two-handed alphabet, and some signs. He prospered in this second family, who along with the community universally adored him.</p>
		<p>His only full-blooded sibling had died in Iowa in 1850. His mother and step-father left the Church for good, and by 1867 all of his half-siblings did so as well. Like Laron Pratt, he was the last member of his original family to remain active, and he was, for the next 32 years until his death.</p>
		<p>How did this once privileged English gentleman, now on a harsh frontier with his fortunes gone, survive the reversals of his life? Back with the zeal of the new convert, John wrote us a letter to tell us, when he was not quite nineteen years old.</p>
		<p>“Reflections by a Deaf and Dumb Young Man” was published in the Church newspaper from Great Britain, the <em>Latter-day Saints’ Millennial Star</em>. Remember, in 1846, Joseph and Hyrum were killed about two-and-a-half years ago. Salt Lake City hasn’t been invented yet. The Territory of Deseret hasn’t been invented yet. But John Sherratt knows how he fits into the story of the Latter-day Saints.</p>
		<p>This is in John’s own words, and for equal access between my hearing guests who don’t know ASL (American Sign Language), and my Deaf friends who don’t know BSL (British Sign Language), let’s watch a bit of it as John might enjoy it. The words are John Sherratt’s, and the signs are an Easter gift from our Deaf brethren in England, who live about 60 miles from where John wrote his letter. He will introduce us to some hearing saints, explain the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, then bear his testimony about Joseph Smith, and his understanding of the importance of baptism. This excerpt will end on his powerful understanding of his place in the Kingdom, from which we take our title today.</p>
		<blockquote>“Elder O. Hyde baptized me, and then my mother and step-father, brother Hewitt, and sisters Belinda Hewitt and Bond, were re-baptized for the remission of sins, on Saturday, 5th December, about one or two o'clock. Who sent them? God sent them, to baptize, or bury down in the water. I love only best, God. Simeon Carter confirmed me, and under his hands, I and all the brethren and sisters who were baptized, received the gift of the Holy Ghost. I wish all people to be baptized. I am very sorry that Joseph Smith and his brother were shot and killed. — The bad mob shot them. God knows all about them. — They were very good, and preach. I wish Joseph Smith was not killed. When Jesus Christ comes here, he will rise from death. The Bible says, ‘thou shalt not kill.’ I love all Saints. I read in the Bible that John baptized Jesus Christ, and Peter baptized three thousand people. The Bible says, ‘that God can give to hear and speak, even the deaf and dumb.’ — God made me deaf and dumb.”</blockquote> 
		<p>Those of us who can sign do hold a slight advantage, because when we read these words on the screen, we can visualize the signs in our heads. The way he writes makes perfect sense in sign language, doesn’t it? It carries a great impact. He continues:</p>
		<blockquote>“I am glad that I was baptized. I wish all people would obey God. I am sure I am for Mormonism: God knows, I must never be cut off from the church....I am sure I never hate Saints.”</blockquote>
		<p>Remember when he was 37 years old, about twenty years after this, that conviction would be tested when he was the last member of his original family still in the Church. I see a testimony of baptism, obedience, and that the Church is true.</p>
		<blockquote>“I must pray to God may give good to his people. If I was bad and quarrelsome, God will be angry with me. I wish to be good, and obey God and my parents, and love the Mormons and Bible, and have care to be good.”</blockquote>
		<p>What is John testifying about?</p>
		<blockquote>“I wonder Almighty God made all earth and mankind. When Joseph Smith was killed, God sent all Saints people to be removed...from Nauvoo...Jesus Christ was crucified in Jerusalem, and he has gone into heaven. Tell people, must not kill and murder.”</blockquote>
		<p>What is he telling us?</p>
		<blockquote>“When I go to church of Latter-day Saints, I cannot hear from preacher, but I can read a Bible or Book of Mormon...</blockquote>
		<p>This man was not a spectator or a mascot in his own spiritual life. If his wife Christina was running late on a Sunday morning, they say he would leave without her, and walk to Church by himself. His nephew remembered that “he loved to dress up and go to church...He would bear his testimony, quite often, standing tall and proud, his expressive hands carrying his message of humble gratitude to a congregation who understood and admired him.” Today was the first time his testimony had been signed in his native language since he died in 1899. [Sign AMEN]</p>
		<p>Without these good people, Doug Stringham and I would not be able to adequately repay our debt to these good people, by learning their stories and turning them over to you.</p>
		<p>For the balance of our time tonight, I would like to hear from you. Maybe you are among their literal posterity, or maybe you have inherited their spiritual legacy. Tell us what you felt here tonight, or tell us about a time you were unsure if the audience would be able to understand your testimony, or unable to express yourself in the language of the congregation. Come up to the front if you want to speak or sign, or there is a copy signer here if you are going to sign and stay seated.</p>
