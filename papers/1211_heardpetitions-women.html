	<h1>‘He Hath Heard Thy Petitions’:<br>The First Generations of Deaf Women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</h1>
	<p>Historically, their journeys and spaces largely unknown and misperceived, Deaf women of the first one hundred years of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints traversed boundaries of church, community, and family in their own right. Though Deaf, female, and Latter-day Saint by Providence, most were at some point, displaced by the aggressive marginalization of these stations in latter 19th- and early 20th-century public discourse. The treatment of gender marginalization and perception during this time period is well documented in the literature; indeed, the corpus will be enlarged again over these three days. the lack of any deaf narrative of this time period simply reinforces the marginalization.</p>
	<p>Deafness, especially during this time period, is often accompanied with the perception that it is a deficit, a lack of ability, and a lack of sense. As long-held Aristotelian ideology—or equating the lack of hearing with an inability to learn—was institutionalized by philosophers, educators, and clergy of the 19th century, they considered deafness a moral and cognitive constraint. For all the reports and histories of their many abilities and exploits in the arts and technology during the mid 19th century<sup><a href="#001">1</a></sup>, narratives constructed about deaf people of the late 1800s still tinted them as “pathetic,” “ignorant,” “unfortunate,” and “deprived.”<sup><a href="#001">1</a></sup></p>
	<p>Further, eugenic experiments on Deaf people into the new century ranged from actual bodily experimentation and modification to the legal prohibition of Deaf intermarriage in order to eradicate the condition altogether. Concerning their salvation, Hannah Joyner has written how evangelical Southerners saw deafness in their children and family members as an absolute crushing disability and impediment to a happy life while Douglas Baynton has pointed out that, antebellum Deaf education was focused on soul saving and Christian living (Baynton, 1998). In the early Latter-day Saint tradition, church members and leaders reconciled deafness by invoking Biblical admonitions, such as Isaiah 35 and Matthew 11, to “heal” and “cause the...deaf to hear.” Until they were made “whole,” however, Deaf people were considered to be perpetual recipients of charity, and consequently, if divine appeals were successful, instruments to glorify God (cf. Matthew 15).</p> 
	<p>However, Deaf Latter-day Saint women charted new territories and recontexted familial and social spaces, not <em>despite</em> their deafness, but <em>because</em> of it. Women were the first Deaf converts to the new Latter-day Saint movement and the first to receive its temple blessings. Notwithstanding societal hindrances to education or literacy, Deaf women traveled continents with their pioneer families, settled townships alongside their neighbors, and scaffolded spaces in the nascent Deaf Latter-day Saint community as its first leaders, recordkeepers, and confidants.</p>
	<p>In this article, we present existing and currently-developing narratives of Deaf Latter-day Saint women—the Pioneer, the Immigrant, the Sister Wife, the Scholar, the Advocate—sisters, wives, mothers, and leaders who not only impacted their immediate courses but also beat down the trails that present-day Deaf Latter-day Saints now travel.</p>
	
	<h1>Definitions and contexting</h1>
	<p>For context, the terms “Deaf-Mute” and “deaf and dumb” (terms which Deaf people of the time period were regularly called) are analogous to the contemporary term “Deaf,” which members of the American Deaf community use not as an audiological designation, but a cultural and linguistic identifier. To perhaps draw a comparison, we meet today under the intentional auspices of a “Womens’ Studies” academic banner, not simply a conference about “non-males.”</p> 
	<p>Though the descriptions of “deaf-mute” and “deaf and dumb” are certainly anachronistic and offensive today, we choose to maintain historicity here because the Deaf people about which we are narrating used these labels eponymously. Additionally, while the current descriptor “American Sign Language” has been in use since the 1960s, during the time period our presentation covers, the term “ASL” and its political connotations simply did not exist. The roughly historical equivalent term during the period covered would have been “signs” or “the sign language.” This housekeeping is important because our research is not based in a framework of <em>dis</em>ability (or the inability to hear) but instead on the community of <em>ability</em> (or the value of common language and experience).</p>
	
	<h1>The Pioneer</h2>
	<p>At least twelve to fourteen (and likely more) Deaf women, Latter-day Saint or otherwise, are known to have traveled to the Utah Territory between 1847 and 1880.</p>
	<p>Several more were born in the Territory shortly after their families arrived in the Salt Lake Valley and in other early hub settlements. Other British and east coast converts to the faith like Mary Garner, Maria Keller, and Hannah Clegg populated the peripheries of Deseret and made small yet memorable contributions to their emergent communities. If nothing else, it is evident that Deaf Latter-day Saint women furrowed their places as mid-19th century pioneers and colonizers.</p>
	<h2>Charity Skeen</h2>
	<p>In 1831, John Lowe Butler married Caroline Skeen, the seventh of ten children, and the sister of three deaf siblings. In the spring of 1835, Mormon missionaries arrived in Simpson County, Tennessee and converted and baptized twenty-two souls. On March 1, 1835, Butler invited the Mormon elders into his home and allowed them to preach “the first principles as set down in the New Testament.” John “knew every word they said to be truth for I had the testimony of it.” John and Caroline were baptized into the faith eight days later on 9 March 1835; John’s mother, realizing she had put off baptism, also requested the elders’ services. But the elders also had another interested party:</p>
	<blockquote>“Now my wife's [Caroline Farozine Skeen] sister, Charity was deaf and dumb and, hearing the fuss that was made about the Mormons, she came to my wife and asked her the meaning of it all, and my wife told her as well as she could by signs...that it was the true and everlasting gospel that they preached and that they were sent of God and also that she had been baptized for remission of her sins. The Lord then opened her understanding and she told my wife that she would be baptized too, by the man sent of God, but my wife told her that she had better not as her father was very much opposed to Mormonism and that he would lay all the blame upon her, but Charity persisted in being baptized. This all took place just after the elders [Elders James Emmett and Peter Dustin] had departed, so when the elders turned back again, they knew the Lord wanted them for some wise purpose and when they came into the house, there were two sisters waiting to be baptized; so they baptized them, blessed them and departed on their journey, rejoicing in the Lord their God.”</blockquote>
	<p>Caroline’s concern that her father would be antagonistic to Charity’s excitement about her new faith proved to be accurate; an overprotective father and brothers would not allow Charity to accompany John and Caroline to the Mormon settlements in Missouri and Illinois. Seven years later, in the fall of 1842, then a missionary, Butler “...visited my friends in Tennessee, and found them bitter opponents against the Church....” To his surprise, however, John “found my wife’s sister, Charity, still clinging to the kingdom of God, and wanting to go home with me to Nauvoo[, Illinois], and wanting to go home with me to Nauvoo but her brothers tried to stop her from going with me.”</p>
	<p>For all the animus of her family toward her decision and complete lack of access to religious instruction, Charity, like Jacob of old, patiently waited seven years for the object of her faith, and was reunited with her sister Caroline just after the beginning of the new year. In one of the first public instances of plural marriage during the Church’s Nauvoo era, Charity was sealed to John Lowe Butler on December 23, 1844 and the three of them served missions to Iowa and South Dakota between 1844 and 1846.</p>
	<p>In late 1847, Butler recorded that Charity’s brother came to visit the family to return her home to their Tennessee family. Historian William Hartley claims that Charity “died there [in Tennessee] among her Skeen relatives,” mistakenly assigning her younger sister Polly’s 1854 death date to Charity.</p>
	<p>Research of federal census and state Deaf school records, however, shows Charity alive in Kentucky as late as 1858, then Sumner County, Tennessee in 1860, in Simpson County, Kentucky again in 1870, and eventually with her brother in Nebraska. Charity never traveled to the Utah Territory and it is unlikely that she ever met any other Deaf Latter-day Saints, yet her dedication to her faith despite familial and linguistic obstacles is an important chapter in the Deaf Mormon narrative.</p>
	
	<h2>Sarah Eckersley (Crompton) Robinson</h2>
	<p>Born 15 February 1844 in Oldham, Lancashire, England, the daughter of William and Hannah Hardy Eckersley, both converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Sarah Eckersley, with her parents and three sisters, emigrated to the United States in 1845, landing in St. Louis after a six-week sea voyage aboard the traveling ship Palmyra. At some point into the voyage, Sarah’s parents noticed that she did not respond to ambient sounds. From the deck of the ship, William shot his pistol in the air, intending for Sarah to respond. When Sarah made no reply, her parents realized that she had lost her hearing.</p> 
	<p>William died during the winter of 1847–1848; in 1850, when Sarah was six years old, she and her family relocated to Council Bluffs, Iowa. (1850 Census). There, Sarah’s mother Hannah met and married John Crompton; they added three more daughters and one son to the family. Sarah was just nine years old when her family joined the Henry Ettleman Pioneer Company and traveled to Salt Lake City in 1853. Forty people and eleven wagons (families) were in the company when it left the outfitting post at Keokuk, Iowa on July 1 and arrived in Salt Lake City on October 1, 1853. Once her family arrived in the Deseret Territory, they lived for a short time at Cottonwood, later moved southwest to Camp Floyd (now Fairfeld), and then finally settled in Lake City (now American Fork) in 1860. Sarah was likely the first Deaf Latter-day Saint to settle in Utah County.</p>
	<p>An attractive slight woman with black hair and blue eyes, Sarah was meticulous about maintaining a visual environment of order and natural beauty and people loved her genuine good nature; she enjoyed going to socials and was popular at dances. Sarah became the second wife to William Robinson on 15 December 1867 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City; in the 1870 Federal census, she is listed living alone with their first child. After William’s first wife died, Sarah willingly cared for his seven children, eventually adding five more of their own.</p>
	<p>Sarah possessed a remarkable instinct to sense when her children were stirring or when danger was near. Her neighbors were consistently amazed at how, though they themselves hadn’t heard a noise, Sarah would intuitively hurry off to tend to an awakened child. It was also told of Sarah that she used this instinct to chase an intruder out of her home. Her children recollected that upon returning home one day, Sarah sensed the presence of someone in the house. As she quietly stepped to her bed and looked under, Sarah found an intruder crouched and waiting for her. Ill-prepared for a beating at the hands of an armed housewife, she whacked the man repeatedly with a broom and chased the scoundrel from the house, beating him as she chased.</p>
	<p>In 1871, at a time when membership was determined by character and contribution, Sarah was admitted to the American Fork [Utah] Relief Society. Her contributions of soap and clothing were meager but likely measured the value of her own ‘widow’s mite.’ While she was probably adept at some measure of speechreading, Sarah’s deafness was an asset to her family; she used signed language with her friends, neighbors, and family, and created unique methods for identifying and calling to her children. Despite ward members’ inability to understand her language, Sarah “gleaned a remarkable spirit by her attendance at church,” and it was said of her that her spirituality and strength far outbalanced any inability to hear a sermon.</p>
	
	<h1>The Immigrant</h1>
	<h2>Emma Chivrell Barrell</h2>
	<p>In the winter of 1867–1868, future Latter-day Saint apostle Moses Thatcher recorded his encounters with the William and Eliza Chivrell family as he served a mission in the British Midlands:</p>
	<blockquote>Coventry, 1867 Monday December 9. “Bro Chariton and I conversed a while to two deaf and dumb girls -- (one by Cheverils daughter and the other Louisa Ball) of whom I think I have written in my other journal. We talked to them by means of writing.”</blockquote>
	<blockquote>Leamington, Sunday Feb[ruary] 16 [1868] “Dinner with bro. Chiverell & family...The oldest daughter is a nice looking intelligent girl but is unfortunately deaf and dumb.”</blockquote>
	<p>Upon joining the faith, the Chivrell family emigrated to Salt Lake City in 1870; shortly after her arrival at age 26, the “nice looking intelligent girl,” Emma Chivrell, married 27-year-old fellow Englishman Henry Charles Barrell in the Salt Lake Temple in August. An accomplished entertainer, Tabernacle Choir musician, and later confidant of church president John Taylor during the exile period, Barrell was also named the first superintendent of the Deaf-Mute Sunday School in 1892, likely for his sign language fluency, developed because of his natural interaction with Emma. Emma often parented alone during her husband’s periods in hiding with President Taylor from 1882 to 1887, his mission to England in the late 1880s, and in his calling as a “special nurse” to Wilford Woodruff until 1892. Though he was absent from family life often, his personal writings are replete with expressions of devotion and admiration for Emma’s strength.</p>
	<p>Emma would not only have been a parishioner in her husband’s new Deaf-Mute Sunday School, but also likely a nurturing figure and one of a small handful of Deaf adult role models available to the young students boarding at the school for the Deaf. In a patriarchal blessing given her by John Smith in 1875, Emma was promised that “He [God] hath heard thy petitions and accepted of thy sacrifice”; for a Deaf woman of the late 1800s and whose primary intercessory language was not auditory but manual, it must have been of remarkable comfort to know that when she raised her hands in supplication to heaven, they were accepted by a God who knew those hands.</p>
	
	<h1>The Sister Wives</h1>
	<p>Every Deaf Latter-day Saint who crossed the plains either never married or entered into polygamous families. Marriage to non-Deaf Saints was the rule until 1889, when Hugh Jacob and Isabella West were married in the Manti Temple, the first recorded Church solemnization of two Deaf people (reference). Early plural marriage arrangements involving Deaf sisters created spaces where self-reliance and independence was not outsourced but fostered. Social scientist Jerome Schein has written that, among ethnic groups, Deaf peoples have the highest rate of endogamy at about 90% (Schein, 1989); historian Harlan Lane summarizes several reasons for these relationships including behavioral norms, values and customs, kinship, and, of course, language. (Lane, 2005).</p>
	<p>Deaf multi-sibling (the Becks, the Burks, the Eggintons, the Heiners, the Keeleys, the Wrights, and the Youngs), polygamist (the Footes, the Wests, and the Newells), and even multi-generational Deaf families formed the early nucleus of the Utah Deaf community, and, by extension, Deaf Latter-day Sainthood.</p>
	
	<h2>Mary Irene Foote Cutler</h2>
	<p>Perhaps the first Deaf person born in the Salt Lake Valley, Mary Irene Foote was born 22 October 1855 at Union Fort at the southern end of Salt Lake City. Her parents Warren Foote and Artemisia Sidnie Myers were both converts to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the Kirtland and Nauvoo periods; Mary’s parents and two older brothers were part of the Warren Foote Company which left Kanesville, Iowa (Winter Quarters) on 17 June 1850 and arrived in Salt Lake City on September 17, 18, and 26, 1850.</p> 
	<p>Mary became Deaf at sixteen months after she contracted scarlet fever, however, despite her lack of formal schooling (there was no school for the Deaf in the Territory until 1884), she was well taught and trained by her father (a schoolteacher and farmer) and mother, learning to cook, pick cotton, raise sugar cane, and make molasses in the family home. When Mary was sixteen, the family relocated south to Glendale, Utah and on XX December 1875, she married Morton Brigham (M.B.) Cutler at age 20. Mary and M.B. lived in a one-room cabin with very little furniture; Mary spent much of her time alone while M.B. spent long days tending to their sheep.</p>
	<p>It may have been for this reason that M.B. entered into plural marriage with Mary’s Deaf sister, Artemesia, in 1880 and the two families lived next to each other in Glendale. In the spring of 1889, M.B. was convicted of unlawful cohabitation and spent six months in the Utah territorial penitentiary. Mary faced challenges running the family homestead in M.B.’s absence, several times interacting with the Navajos that came to the farm. Mary and Artemesia couldn’t speak to the Indians, but likely gestured with them to communicate; Mary would give them food and they would depart, never hurting or harming anyone.</p>
	<p>Likely, Mary was efficient in communicating with her community and neighbors, but she also used sign language with her two Deaf sisters, her younger sister’s Deaf spouse, her own Deaf daughter, and taught her language to her children and grandchildren. Though members of her community and ward did not fully understand her language, Mary often expressed her love for the Lord and the Gospel. She taught her family honesty, truthfulness, and integrity and shared her testimony for modern-day prophets, sustained by her personal experiences with many of them.</p>
	
	<h2>Harriet Atwood Newell Russell</h2>
	<p>Harriet Atwood Newell was born 9 March 1829 in Locke, Cayuga County, New York to William Laertus Newell and Belinda Eddy. Very little is known about Harriet’s childhood or how she became Deaf, although it is known that her sister Maria Ann was also Deaf. Their father died in 1845 before Latter-day Saint pioneers left Illinois and Iowa. Harriet received a patriarchal blessing on January 12, 1846, when she was seventeen years old:</p>
	<blockquote>Sister Harriet...I also seal the blessing of health upon thee and I ask my Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus to remove thine affliction to cause thine ears to be opened that thou mayest hear every word that is spoken distinctly. That thou mayest also be made to speak, thy tongue be loosed that thou mayest converse with old Joseph distinctly and understandingly and I pray God the Eternal Father to manifest his power unto thee to manifest his mercy in power to removing thine afflictions that thy heart may be made glad....</blockquote>
	<p>Harriet was a devoted mother and faithful member of the Church her entire life, and, despite the “affliction” which Patriarch Smith claimed was her deafness, there is no record that Harriet ever had her “ears to be opened” nor her “tongue be loosed.” Harriet communicated in sign language to her sister and her family throughout her adult life. Although Harriet, Maria Ann, nor their mother Belinda are listed in the company’s records, it is presume they travelled in the combined George A. Smith and Dan Jones (they likely also combined with the Ezra T. Benson Company) Companies which left the outfitting post at Kanesville, Iowa (present day Council Bluffs) on July 14, 1849. The combined companies’ 370 to 447 individuals and 120 wagons arrived in Salt Lake City October 26-30, 1849. Twenty-year-old Harriet and her twenty-three-year-old Deaf sister Maria Ann were likely the first Deaf Latter-day Saints to enter the Salt Lake Valley; both are also enumerated on the 1851 Utah Territory census.</p>
	<p>In January 1846 in the Nauvoo Temple, Harriet was the first recorded Deaf Latter-day Saint to receive temple blessings and was later a second wife sealed to Amasa Russell on May 1, 1850 in Salt Lake City. Census records indicate that, sometime between 1850 and 1860, Amasa and Harriet (and her sister Maria Ann) moved to Payson, Utah where they lived for at least fifteen to twenty years.</p>
	<p>In 1881, Alma Butler, Harriet’s son-in-law “, recorded in his journal: </p>
	<blockquote>I was called to St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona,... in February 1881 to help settle that part of the country...</blockquote>
	<p>Harriet also had two Deaf grandchildren, Riley and Ruth Carter, who were educated at the Utah School for the Deaf, both influential in their respective religious and civic communities.</p>
		
	<h1>The Scholar</h1>
	<h2>Clarissa Foote</h2>
	<p>When Mary Irene and Artemesia Foote were nineteen and sixteen, they were finally baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (reference). The occasion was probably precipitated by their youngest sister Clarissa, also Deaf, turning nine; every non-Deaf sibling born between them had been baptized years before. Surely as Clarissa brought overdue baptism to her older sisters, the three girls also shared temple blessings. At merely fourteen-and-a-half years old, young “Clara” as she was known, received her endowments along with her sister Mary Irene, who had traveled to St. George to prepare to be sealed to her husband M.B. Cutler and his second wife, their sister Artemesia. For the rest of her life, Clarissa would lead a more progressive life than her older Deaf sisters, and never be held back by her circumstances.</p>
	<p>The Foote family maintained close social, filial, and economic ties, and Clara was only too happy to remain with her parents and tend to her frail mother. A month before turning twenty-three, Clara was recruited by the Territorial School for the Deaf to begin her education the summer of 1888; as a non-paying student, she was eligible to remain for three years. Torn between the pragmatic benefits for their third Deaf daughter and very real emotional loss, the principal assured them</p>
	<blockquote>“We can appreciate the self-sacrifice you and Mrs. Foote make at your time of life, to give your daughter an education. There have been other cases like yours, where the daughter was a help to the parents, but they [were] sent here to be educated...From what you wrote of Clarissa’s intelligence, we know that she will make rapid progress in her studies...We have one young man 23 years old, who learned as much in two years as the rest did in four, and he is in the first class. Expect the same thing in your daughter” (reference).</blockquote>
	<p>Though her parents accepted the overwhelming possibility that Clarissa was on a trajectory of success that arced away from their family, their sacrifice actually gave helped their daughter in a way unimaginable with the first two. Upon receiving a letter from her a few days prior, her father recorded in January 1890,</p>
	<blockquote>I received a letter from my daughter, Clarissa, who is in Salt Lake City going to the school for the Deaf and Dumb. As she has not been to school only about 13 months, I will copy it to show the rapid progress she has made in learning to compose letters, as this is her own composition:<br>“Salt Lake City Jan. 4th 1890<br>My Dear Father:<br>I received a letter from you three weeks ago. I was glad. I am well. My mother has the rheumatism in her back. I am sorry...</blockquote>
	<p>He marvelled, “Thirteen months ago she did not know the meaning of letters or words. I feel very thankful that she can write and compose a letter as good as the foregoing.” For the rest of her life, she kept up regular correspondence with her family, and always longed to be near them. In that first letter, one of her life strategies emerges — Clara trades strained social situations for making something useful and beautiful. The letter continues:</p>
	<blockquote>“I did not have a very good time at my cousins. I felt lonesome. I was glad to get back to school and talk with the girls. I wrote to my uncle. I made my dress while I was at my cousin’s. It is pretty. I want to see you and mother.<br>My love all to the folks, Clara Foote” (reference).</blockquote>
	<p>Clara’s niece Mamie reported that the school claimed that if able to remain “4 or 5 years [Clara] would make an excellent scholar.” (WFJ p. 227 Jan 1890) After two years of formal education, she solidified her position as one of the first recognizably modern Deaf Latter-day Saint women by marrying Andrew Olsen in 1890, an intelligent, devout, and industrious Deaf man whom she met while away at school. He too was an older student — six years older than she — and had been educated first in his native Sweden before emigrating to Utah. U.Des. Roster</p>
	<blockquote>On the occasion of her marriage, her parents’ hearts once again were broken to lose her:<br>Our daughter left us today. It was very hard to part with her. She has been a very obedient girl, and our main stay during her mother’s severe sickness. May the blessings of the Lord attend her through life, and raise up friends to her wherever her lot is cast. I could not part with her without laying my hands upon her head, and bestowing upon her a father’s blessing in accordance with my office and calling. We may never meet again in the flesh, as her home will be about 340 miles from us.<br>Clara’s brother David Foote observed:<br>“She likes living there, but wants her Father and Mother to live near her home...I think she will endeavor to do her whole duty as a wife and abide in the love of God, and he will give her grace to overcome all the ills of life and reward her finally with eternal blessedness with all the Redeemed in His Kingdom.”</blockquote>
	<p>This description was as apt as if it were pronounced at the end of her life. Remembrances of her always include a handmade gift, that she constantly produced, which seemed to be her way of reaching out to others in a tangible way. This social buffer allowed her both to connect with people, and protect her personal space when she could retreat into her room and occupy herself with needlework instead of feeling the stress of social situations.</p>
	<p>Living grandchildren universally remember Clarissa as quiet, gentle, affectionate, patient, and wholly devoted to her family; she welcomed her invalid mother into their home for nine years, even creating a private space for her that included the only window. (Larry Works conversation) According to a life sketch published when Clara was seventy-nine, her daughter claimed, “...Mother’s kind, sweet disposition has never left her. She is always the same even in sickness or pain." The biographer continues, “Her children and grandchildren have always been her first consideration. She has been very industrious and generous to a fault...She has taught her children correct principles, for example, ‘It is much better to suffer a wrong than to do a wrong.’” (Life Sketch by Arvilla Heaton, Kane County Standard 7 Jan 1954)</p>
	
	<h1>The Advocates</h1>
	<p>In 1884, the Utah Territory finally caught up with American Deaf education; of the thirteen students who made up the first enrolling class of the school for the Deaf, five were women. (reference). Education leveled the playing field for Deaf people in the new century; indeed, because they spent between six to eight years in a residential school, many Deaf people were better educated than their non-Deaf neighbors and family members. (reference). Secondary and baccalaureate educational opportunities combined with early 20th century suffrage vaulted Deaf Latter-day Saint women into positions of authority and boundary-pushing. Mormon convert Amy Devine Hawkins was the first written voice and historian of the Latter-day Saint Deaf-Mute Sunday School. (reference). Ten years before universal American suffrage, Elizabeth DeLong became the first president of any political association of the Deaf anywhere in the United States. (reference). Emma Emmertson was not only the first Deaf school graduate to attend the University of Utah, she was also an active participant in the Utah suffrage movement. (reference). Deaf Latter-day Saint women commanded both traditional and atraditional nurturing roles in the early 20th century.</p>
	<h2>Elsie Christiansen</h2>
	<p>On an October afternoon in 1907, Elsie Christiansen, then in her senior year and a 5’10’’ standout on the girls basketball team at the Utah School for the Deaf, stood up in her pew in the Ogden Fourth Ward building just around the corner from her school. In an appropriate and familiar gesture, Elsie’s leaders and peers raised their hands and sustained the seventeen-year-old as the new secretary and treasurer for her congregation, the Latter-day Saint Deaf Mute Sunday School. (reference). Born in Riverton, Utah during the same summer that her school was first founded in 1884, Elsie’s new responsibility would be the first of many over the next fifty years of her professional and ecclesiastical career in Ogden at the school and in the community that would come to view her as a teacher, a confidant, and role model.</p>
	<p>When the Sunday School superintendency was reorganized in January 1911, the twenty-one-year-old Elsie was sustained as the first assistant to the newly-called superintendent, Max Woodbury. (reference). This important association between Woodbury, the Sunday School’s main teacher and leader, and Christiansen, his tutor, confidant, and counselor, would inform the School’s direction for the next six years and help transition it from a weekly gathering of church members to a vital and empowered religious community of Deaf brothers and sisters, the first of its kind in the Latter-day Saint tradition.</p> 
	<p>Elsie also began her teaching career in 1911, succeeding mentor and fellow congregant Elizabeth DeLong as a social studies teacher at the school for the Deaf. (reference). Elsie also took on other responsibilities at the School, working as a houseparent and as an ironing supervisor in the laundry, instructing the high school girls in their then requisite homemaking skills by ironing the boys’ shirts and pajamas. (reference).</p>
	<p>By late 1911 and early 1912, Christiansen was advising Superintendent Woodbury on the need for a dedicated worship space and meetinghouse for Deaf church members. The two would collaborate on a series of correspondence to Church president Joseph F. Smith (reference), explaining the need to leverage architectural features such as sloped chapel floors to enable Deaf congregants to see speakers more clearly and the removal of popular highbacked classroom seating in favor of a more visually-friendly semicircle of desks. (reference).</p>
	<p>Elsie also taught Sunday School classes (reference) and, much like she did in her role as a teacher at the Deaf school, shepherded the spiritual development of the young women in her congregation. (reference). In contrast to the traditional mothers of her congregation, Elsie filled a different yet much-needed mothering role in which she intermingled linguistics and leadership, signs and service. After their new building was completed in late 1916 and the Sunday School was transitioned to the Church’s first-ever branch dedicated for Deaf signing members in February 1917, Elsie was called as its first clerk, a place she would fill for the next thirty-two years. (reference). In a role historically filled by men in the Latter-day Saint tradition, Elsie’s contributions and attention to detail were indispensable to the branch’s maturity; her written notes and recollections served as its texture and voice for the first half of the 20th century. (reference).</p>
	
	<h1>Conclusion</h1>
	<p>Hopefully, observing the interwoven narratives of these women challenges the reader to recontext Deaf people in the Latter-day Saint tradition. On one hand, these stories may feel familiar and unremarkable: nearly everyone has a great-great-grand-someone who experienced hardships on a fill-in-the-blank frontier journey. But on the other hand, these narratives are remarkable because, given their time and context and the framework in which they were viewed by non-Deaf people, they shouldn’t have happened. It is significant that important ‘firsts’ in Deaf Latter-day Sainthood — conversion, the receipt of exalting covenants, and the establishment of congregations — happened to and because of women. Reacting to the shifting societal judgements of their bodies and abilities, these stories represent purposeful and willful stands against the expectations of Deaf women of their respective times. The first generations of Deaf Latter-day Saint women charted new territories and recontexted familial, social, and eschatological spaces for modern-day Saints, not despite their deafness, but because of it.</p>
